1. **Introduction to Resources**:
    - Resources represent an API or a collection that can be accessed from the server.
    - Example: Google.com as the server with different APIs (Google Maps, Google Search, Google Images, Google Docs).
    - Each API has a specific resource name included in the base URL for directing the request.

2. **Mandatory Details for API Requests**:
    - Every API test must include a base URL and resource.
    - Example: `maps` is a resource for Google Maps API.

3. **Parameters in API Requests**:
    - **Path Parameters**: Variable parts that change with each request, used to point to a specific resource within a collection (e.g., specific order in Amazon orders).
    - **Query Parameters**: Used to sort or filter resources, identified with a question mark and separated by an ampersand.

4. **Example of Query Parameters**:
    - Example: Searching for "New York" on Google results in a URL with query parameters (`?q=New+York`).

5. **Constructing an Endpoint**:
    - Base URL (server name).
    - Resource (specific API).
    - Optional parameters (path or query) based on the API's design.

6. **Headers and Cookies**:
    - Headers and cookies provide additional data (metadata) for the API to process the request.
    - Used for authorization, content type specification, etc.

7. **Upcoming Lessons**:
    - Introduction to Postman Tool for manual API testing.
    - The course will cover both manual and automated API testing using REST Assured.
    - Practical examples and designed APIs will be used for hands-on practice.

8. **Next Steps**:
    - Next lecture will focus on practical examples using Postman.
    - Manual testing will be covered before moving on to automation with REST Assured.
